# SigmaFigma_AIAD
A group project for UI/UX (IT4441E) course at HUST

## Access

This project contains two UI flows for two different versions of the AI Design Application (AIAD): a web app and a mobile app. Below are the instructions to access each flow.

### Web App Flow

To access the web application, open the `Web App/src/login.html` file in your browser. The following credentials can be used to log in:

-   **Architect User**
    -   **Email**: `architect`
    -   **Password**: `123456`

-   **Normal User**
    -   **Email**: `normal`
    -   **Password**: `123456`

### Mobile App Flow

To access the mobile application, open the `Mobile/src/login.html` file in your browser. The login is based on the username:

-   **Architect User**: Enter any username that includes the word `arch`.
-   **Normal User**: Enter any username that does not include the word `arch`.

## Figma Project

You can view our Figma project here: [AIAD Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/design/mA6a8kpmUoAKtaYNr2hC83/%E1%BB%A4-%E1%BB%8B-%E1%BB%A5-%E1%BB%8Bch?node-id=0-1&t=t7MoAfvbMmFPk9OZ-1)

### Figma Prototype Link
You can get access to our project on Figma via [web application version](https://www.figma.com/proto/mA6a8kpmUoAKtaYNr2hC83/%E1%BB%A4-%E1%BB%8B-%E1%BB%A5-%E1%BB%8Bch?node-id=509-658&p=f&t=vbTROrg3x2uhRpON-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=509%3A658&show-proto-sidebar=1) or [mobile version](https://www.figma.com/proto/mA6a8kpmUoAKtaYNr2hC83/%E1%BB%A4-%E1%BB%8B-%E1%BB%A5-%E1%BB%8Bch?node-id=694-2223&p=f&t=76JyfI1lW8Sk7fwm-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=388%3A676&starting-point-node-id=694%3A2223&show-proto-sidebar=1).

### Access Instructions
The interactive prototype is divided into four distinct user flows to cover both the Web and Mobile platforms for our two primary user personas (Architect and Normal User). From the above link that I have mentioned in 1.1, you can easily access the specific workflows by using the "Flows" sidebar located on the left side of the screen.

To navigate between the different scenarios, please follow these steps:
- Open the Sidebar: If the left-hand menu is not visible, click the "Show Sidebar" icon in the top-left corner of the Figma interface.
- Select a Flow: Under the "Flows" section, click on one of the following titles to initiate that specific journey:
    - Architect Web Flow
    - Normal User Web Flow
    - Architect Mobile Flow
    - Normal User Mobile Flow
You may switch between these flows at any time to review the different platform adaptations and user privileges.
